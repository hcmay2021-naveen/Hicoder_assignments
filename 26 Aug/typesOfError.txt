There are three types of errors in JavaScript: (a) Syntax Errors, (b) Runtime Errors, and (c) Logical Errors. d)reference errors
Syntax Errors:
Syntax errors are also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript.

Eg: <script>
        alert("my name is naveen
    
    </script>

    here parenthasis missing that is a syntax error
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Runtime Errors::
Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation).

For example, the following line causes a runtime error because here the syntax is correct, but at runtime, it is trying to call a method that does not exist.
eg:<script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      window.printme();
   //-->
</script>
------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical Errors:
Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. These errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error. Instead, they occur when you make a mistake in the logic that drives your script and you do not get the result you expected.

You cannot catch those errors, because it depends on your business requirement what type of logic you want to put in your program
